**Defining the world of OT?**

*The following is a blog I wrote for work which was rejected*

Everyone is familiar with the term Information Technology, or as it is better known, IT.  However, a newly emerging competition in the digital age is Operational Technology, otherwise known as OT. However, OT devices and networks have been around a lot longer then some may think and in many ways pre-date current IT systems. When thinking of OT devices, it is best to think of them in the context of manufacturing plants and assembly lines. Robots and sensors working together to bring automation into the light and keep the manufacturing processes moving along.

Traditionally IT and OT have been kept in separated networks, however with the emergence of the smart device movement these two network boundaries are starting to blur. Traditionally OT device networks have been separated from the internet as closed networks, but recently these have been brought online to deliver smart analytics and add features like remote management and control.  Useful functionality is permitted by utilizing data generated from the various robots and sensors within the manufacturing process to improve the overall effectiveness.

In the past few years the Industrial Internet has started to explode into more general Internet connectivity, as opposed to the historically closed systems that relied more heavily on physical security to ensure integrity. With this shift from closed to open systems comes an even greater interdependence and overlap between the two teams and a slew of new security concerns.

Greater connectivity and integration is obviously beneficial for smart analytics and control, but more connections and networked devices means more opportunities for security holes and vulnerabilities. While security has always been a priority for IT systems, these new OT networked systems like building automation, industrial controls and electric utility grids are presenting new scenarios and risks to both IT and OT networks.

Threats to safety, however are not a new concern to OT networks, but by taking machines and control systems out of a closed system brings the threat of compromised machines, which could potentially cause injury. Additionally, while losing control of the manufacturing process or any related devices is any OT network engineer’s worst nightmare, one must now consider the new security possibility of a malicious actor who can shut down a power plant, halt an industry plant’s production, or reprogram an assembly process to skip a few steps, resulting in a damaged, unusable, or otherwise sabotaged products.

One of the main hurdles with trying to secure OT networks is that IT employees generally have little experience with industrial systems and their traditional security solutions typically aren’t compatible with the needs of industrial control systems. While many on the OT side see the benefits of moving away from closed systems and increasing connectivity, the lack of IT security experience is causing concerns for potential malicious activity on industrial networks.

Addressing and identifying this gap is the first step of analyzing the risk to both the IT and OT networks and an external organization may be needed to ensure a secure and productive Industrial Internet where both IT and OT are properly informed how to work with each other and of what the current best practices in these industries are.
