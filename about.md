  So I just wanted to introduce my self, My name is Michael Galde and I currently live in Omaha Nebraska<br><br>

  I am a student at the University of Nebraska for Information Assurance. I am in the graduate program here and have really found my calling.<br><br><br>

  My undergraduate degree is in Political Science and while I have had some awesome jobs I have found the cyber world calling to me so I decided to answer that call.<br><br><br>

  This blog is the collection of adventures of my journey from knowing nothing to knowing what I know today. <br><br><br><br>
